### Give it a go!

Generate an interactive scatter plot of the word frequency from the 6th and 1st edition of Charles Darwinâ€™s book of evolutionary theory.

```{r}
# Word count from both editions 
darwin <- full_join(darwin1_words, darwin6_words, by = "word") %>%
  rename(n_ed1 = n.x, len_ed1 = len.x, n_ed6 = n.y, len_ed6 = len.y)

# Scatter plot of word count frequency from the 6th and 1st edition
p <- ggplot(darwin, aes(x=n_ed1, y=n_ed6, label=word)) + 
  geom_abline(intercept=0, slope = 1) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
  xlab("1st edition") + ylab("6th edition") +
  scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() + theme(aspect.ratio=1)

# Interactive scatter plot plot
ggplotly(p)
```

#### Q1.Does it look like the 6th edition was an expanded version of the first?

Yes, the most of the words appear more frequently in the 6th edition.

#### Q2.What word is most frequent in both editions?

species.

#### Q3.Which words are not in the first edition but appear in the 6th?

```{r}
darwin %>%
  filter(is.na(n_ed1))
```

2209 words are not in the first edition but appear in the 6th, including "mivart", "prof", "cambrian"...

#### Q4.Which words that are used the first edition but not in the 6th?

```{r}
darwin %>%
  filter(is.na(n_ed6))
```

269 words are used the first edition but not in the 6th, including "deg", "experimentised", "weald"...
